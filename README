Project Purpose

A prototype JCA adapter for Salesforce connections.

Goals

* Provide robust Java EE connectivity to Salesforce.com SOAP services
* Simple configuration (as simple as JCA will allow...)
* Use of standard Salesforce.com WSDL
* Use of enterprise custom WSDLs

Status

The adapter is working and deployable but provides no actual connections.
Currenly working out how to elegantly broker multiple types of SOAP endpoint.
